    "description": "Like Ethereum's tranquility, the capybara is a gentle and slow-paced animal, radiating a Zen-like calm. CapybaraCoin ($CAPY) is a meme coin designed to mock Ethereum, satirizing the hubris of crypto VCs and core developers. It also pays homage to all meme coins and inscriptions that were launched fairly.",
